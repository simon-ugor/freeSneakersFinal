                <h3 className="aboutus-heading">How Streetwear restyled the world?</h3>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Until the very recent years, streetwear has been the niche of interest. It is known and loved by teenagers and all those that know of this style of clothing. In the past 3 years, streetwear has been a highly recognized and celebrated version of the fashion industry.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear staples, including printed tees, hoodies, tracksuits, and trainers, have been viewed in almost all of the biggest fashion shows and runways and collaborations backed by celebrities. All this is not unusual these days.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Since back in the 60s, designers have been very actively creating couture collections all inspired by streetwear. Still, the very new twits over fashion continue to blur lines between designer and the sportswear with a notion that if any piece of streetwear, it won't mean that it isn't perfect to be designed.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">1. Streetwear got redesigned:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear has been linked with hip hop and urban streetwear staples, which are held in higher records. Thanks to the cult brands and labels such as Off-white, Supreme, and Yeezy, it has also become a higher fashion.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The portrayal of the staples and brands on the catwalk have all helped its full redesign, with a dramatic catwalk staging, long-awaited collaborations, and models in masks catching the eyes of those that are yet to include in the trend of the latest designs.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">2. The biggest streetwear trends in 2019:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Every year, there are also predictions as to what the year's main trends will be. It's always fashion week with a lot more fashion weeks than a week in a year. And in the current year's streetwear and urban fashion have also taken over most of the catwalks. Most of these trends have been seen before in streetwear or were also seen right in the time of streetwear ideas.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">3. The arrival of spots and stripes:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>In women's fashion, the animal print is something that is very least revolutionary. But, for men's fashion, the striped coat, polka dot shirt, and the leopard printed tees are a lot let likely to be seen and felt like a lot more of the risk when it comes to wearing these.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">4. The down-filled coats:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The puffer jackets and coats were big in the 80s and 90s, and many people still wear these. But, what has already changed is that they are moving away from the hugely unshaped and oversized puffers that we are so used to wearing and are in bright Crayola colors. Now, instead of hiding your entire outfit, they are adding the finishing touch. Many people pick to wear them keeping unzipped, making the most of the layering trend to showcase their wearing without even feeling cold.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">5. The brighter colors:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Neon is the trend that many of us have experienced in the past years, with it mostly disappearing and making a major comeback a few years ahead. It is also expected to fizzle out after a few seasons, but it returns bigger than before.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>This year isn't different, with many people brightening up the dullness of the colder seasons with the pop of neon here or there, and neon green is mainly going to be big this year. Some the stage story about streetwear fashion:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>To any casual person, 9 am Friday 24th, February was business all as usual in London's Soho. Commuters hastened to their work, shutters of shops were raised open, rubbish trucks were steamed along. But at 26 Brewer Street, a group of teenagers queued up were snacking in the block. But for what? To have their hands on the latest design released by famous streetwear labels.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>This hype beast created for consumers hungry for anything realized in the streetwear collection in any week. Streetwear fashion has always made fans go crazy for the new releases, which is why they queue up outside stores to grab the clothing articles first hand.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Following are those items that are always in the streetwear clothing style and are required to have in your wardrobe if you have a craze for streetwear:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>1. Sneakers:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>It is just impossible to discuss streetwear without talking about sneakers first. The global athletic footwear market is not estimated to reach over $94.15 billion in the coming 2025. It is also seen that sneakers are the top-selling items at a percentage of 72% of luxury streetwear brands.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>2. Logo tees:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The hip hop streetwear is full of logo tees that signify famous brands that are mostly of clothing. While putting your logo on the t-shirt started only as a niche trend among skateboarders, it also became the norm in streetwear brands. Like sneakers, graphic tees became a lot more popular due to product scarcity and high demand.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Both these products may easily sell for around 3 to 4 times the original value they hold. Streetwear t-shirts are always going to be in style no matter which style niche comes up.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>3. Sweatpants:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Sweats have gone from being lazy clothing items to being luxury. Streetwear rose to huge popularity at the same time as one other major fashion movement: athleisure. And due to the pandemic, sweatpants are 100% acceptable to be worn in public.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>4. Denim jackets:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>For many years, denim jackets have been around in the wardrobe of streetwear enthusiasts of all ages, styles, and genders. Denim jackets are worn by layering them on sweatshirts or t-shirt. Oversized fits, vintage-inspired styles, and distressed washes are the popular choices in the current year.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Many streetwear brands keep producing this clothing item in new and old designs and styles as well.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>These are a few clothing items that are always listed under streetwear and will always be in there. Most streetwear brands realize new forms of the same fashion pattern, and it can't get any cooler. Which of these items are you wearing right now, and which do you want to buy more?</p>
