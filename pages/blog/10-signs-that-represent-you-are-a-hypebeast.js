                <h3 className="aboutus-heading">10 signs that represent you are a Hypebeast</h3>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Do you know what a hypebeast is and what is referred to from this term? A definition of hypebeast is "sneakerheads that only rock hyped up stuff to get props as they have no self-worth or a sense of style." But the second definition does a lot more truth, and in reality, they are more than only kids having hardcore sneakers and popular obsession with brands. </p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>You are not a hype beast only because you like any particular brand or a luxury product line. The reality is that anyone can be a fan of shoes and higher-end brands, but not all are into those things for similar reasons.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Some people find happiness in having a hype beast life, hence to each their own. But that doesn't take us away from a few negative undertones that come with the hype beast classification. Everyone has their definition of what a hypebeast is, but there are a few certain things that you will agree on for sure:</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">1. You focus most on spending on all the latest gears instead of on basic necessities:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}> If you are a real hype beast, you mostly don't consider the price tag important in buying decisions. Money is also not an issue. You will get the funds for this cop of yours somehow, whether it means getting overtime on your jobs or getting over your knees and begging from your guardians or parents to get extra allowances.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">2. Your main sense of fashion is wearing any of the high-end brands altogether:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If you are a real hype beast, you are heavily branded from head to toe. Your outfit may not match, but as long as every single piece is high-end, you are happy to exist in this attire. A few hype beasts color coordinate, while the others have no idea of color coordination whatsoever.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">3. You take full pride in your extensive snapback and sneaker collection:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If you are a real hype beast, you have a bit area of your room or house dedicated to showing your kicks. You are bound to have the pair of Olive 9s, Concords, Olympic 7s somewhere in the whole mix. When people come over, you just want them to notice your sneaker shrine so that you can talk all about how having those sneakers wasn't any big deal for you at all.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">4. You think a brand you haven't heard of before is a whack:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If you are a real hype beast, you will not dare buy or wear anything not hyped up online. You are interested in things that are getting traction and popularity in the general public and dismiss anything featured on hypebeast.com. The more exposed a brand is, the more you are eager to get your hands on it.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">5. You buy clothing items just because they are brand names, even though you don't like them personally:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If you are a real hype beast, you will buy the Boy London backpack even though it is the weirdest thing you have ever seen. For you, it is all about branding. The logo may be microscopic, but as long as you can prove that it is an authentic piece of a luxury item, you are right into it.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">6.	You are influenced mainly by celebrity streetwear than an average consumer:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If you are a real hype beast, you are persuaded easily by what celebrities are wearing. You may want anything that they have. You don't care if a clothing line looks like it has been processed through a meat processor, but if it is by a popular brand, you have it!</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">7.	You will camp out for many hours on end to cop that limited edition item:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If you are a real hypebeast, you will set up your whole camp in line just so that you can get your hands on those next sneakers released by Drake. Unlike most people in the line only because they are genuine sneaker fans, you are in line only because everyone else is. You are a lot more dedicated to the hype than buying those shoes for your own need.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">8.	You believe self-worth is all measured in Instagram likes:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Being a real hype beast, like dropping into your Instagram, fuel your fire. You want to be highly insta famous, to be seen as a fashion icon in your area. After every post you make, you monitor your Instagram account to see the counter going up. This is one of the most important parts of the day.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">9. You gear up all the times you go out:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If you are a real hype beast, it won't matter where you are going or what you are headed out for. You will floss up over to the maximum degree as appearances are the 'it' thing for you. You may just be going to do some laundry and still be fleshed out in those Rick Owens bombers, white Huaraches, and Climacools.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">10. Your most hated enemy is precipitation:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>It is rather hard to keep looking fresh when you have to worry about getting the gear wet. But you will not bail; you will still go out as you will take all of the opportunities for exposure that you may get.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>These are the 10 signs you are hypebeast.
