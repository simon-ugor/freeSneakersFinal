                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The dress code used to be simpler and more sophisticated in the past. People nowadays choose to dress in amusing outfits that make them appear fashionable. With the rapid advancement of technology, this fashion is on the increase in Western countries. This isn't a fad; it has existed for decades. The fact that you may design and appreciate your style is our favourite aspect of streetwear.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear labels are more than fashion; they're a cultural phenomenon that has shaped trends throughout the years and continues to surprise the industry. One of the best reasons to choose streetwear fashion is that you can wear whatever you want or whenever you want, as long as it defines you and makes you happy. People may make assumptions about you based on what you wear; you are not a copy, unlike everyone else.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Both new and renowned streetwear labels are at the forefront of keeping fashionistas up to date with the newest trends. Here are ten reasons to choose Streetwear fashion.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Why to choose streetwear?</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>1. Very comfortable</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>For some people, it is more comfortable; for example, streetwear pants are frequently baggy. Some people prefer baggy pants because they are loose and allow them to walk freely. Lengthened formal suits appear easygoing, making them ideal for de-stressing.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>People in busy city life are accustomed to wearing formal suits, which are tight and serve as a reminder of work stress. High-end streetwear clothes composed of high-quality textiles such as cashmere and silk are available.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>2. Stand out from the crowd</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear apparel is distinguished from traditional clothes by the tightness of the shirts and slacks. Many streetwear clothes have a little style, such as being baggy, ragged, and extended. Young folks may prefer this type of style since it makes them stand out from the crowd.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Different looks, on the other hand, have meaning in today's fashion. It is ideal for young people who are continuously looking for new experiences.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>3. It changes all the time</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear fashion doesn't only follow the newest trends; they also adapt and create them. Choosing Streetwear clothing distinguishes you as a trendsetter rather than a follower. Local streetwear brands are the ones that originate trends, from cross-body bags to bucket hats, and wholesalers are the ones who rapidly jump on the trend afterwards.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>It's critical to uncover the most low-key companies before your peers do to keep ahead of the ever-changing fashion world. The best aspect is that newer generations are developing their own styles, and no one seems to halt the new streetwear craze.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>4. It's Classic</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>When you wear your Baby Phat sweater from the 2000s, heads will turn to see the once-popular brand. The more vintage the brand and item, the better. It's all about the retro look these days. What's amazing about streetwear is that it never goes out of style.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Whether or not wearing your father's Champion hoodie and sneakers from the 1980s makes you the coolest kid on the block, investing in streetwear is like investing in timeless style.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>5. More enjoyable and informal</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>They're more lighthearted and appropriate for folks with a less serious demeanour. They place a greater focus on having fun with their outfits rather than a neat and professional appearance like office attire. People that dress in streetwear tend to live a more active lifestyle. It's perfect for those who want to show off their quirky individuality through their apparel.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>6. Doesn't have any historical connetation</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>It boasts an innovative design that anticipates the future. It is a recent fashion world that has no historical meaning. It's not like vintage attire, which harkens back to when people were struggling to make ends meet. If it is, people may point their fingers at the clothes and make negative remarks, potentially igniting a heated debate.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>7. No strict dress codes</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>There are no precise criteria for streetwear fashion. To produce a distinctive look, a variety of elements, such as cuff width, plackets, and so on, can be modified. However, you should expect people to comment on your outfit wherever you go because it is still not commonly accepted. The world is changing to future-style apparel, and it will take time for high-end streetwear to react.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>8. Trendy and attractive in every country</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear is the newest fashion trend that is gaining popularity among teenagers all around the world. Kids who are concerned about their appearance at school are willing to invest in streetwear gear.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>They don't simply wear these garments to show off at school; they also prefer to post pictures of themselves wearing them on the internet. They would take images of themselves wearing streetwear apparel with their smartphones in exchange for many likes on social media.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>9. Frequently debut designs</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>It's available in a variety of styles that don't all look the same. Streetwear Fashion will never weary you because new designs are continuously being introduced. They're all created by expert designers and have the same futuristic vibe.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>It's easy to get one because they're sold in many designer retailers. Given the numerous variances, few people will purchase the same streetwear gear. It's perfect for folks who wish to be different and want to wear new things before anyone else.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>10. Reveal your personality and style</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>We've been told what to do, what to wear, how to think, and how to act our entire lives; with streetwear, we're challenging that thinking and saying no more. You do, dress, think, and behave in the ways that we desire, in the ways that we are most comfortable, and in the ways that we want to live our lives.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>So wear whatever you want, like a hoodie with ripped jeans or whatever you feel comfortable in. You can wear streetwear to show off your personality and character. It does not have to have any text printed on it. The design speaks for itself about the person's personality. You can, for example, acquire streetwear pants with holes around the knee areas if you have a tough mentality.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>These witty garments are a terrific way to spark a conversation. If you're meeting someone new and want to learn more about him, you can dress casually.</p>
