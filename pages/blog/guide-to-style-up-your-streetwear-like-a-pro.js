                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Thought to have originated in the 1970’s in California and associated with skaters’ fashion and punk rock, streetwear today, is creating a revolution in urban fashion. When originally streetwear fashion was all about comfort and straightforward, but today, streetwear has been merged with high-end fashion. 
                Graphic printed tees, limited edition items (doesn’t always have to be luxe), bomber vests or jackets, sweatshirts, joggers, hoodies, streetwear logos, etc. are some basics of streetwear fashion.  
                If you are attempting in improving your streetwear style, then we have some incredible tips that will seamlessly help you fit in to the world of streetwear fashion. So how to style up your streetwear like a pro?</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Single Logo</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Wearing streetwear fashion is all about staying loyal to a single brand.  True streetwear fashions are not usually seen wearing clothing or accessories from different brands. If you have more than one streetwear mark in your cupboard, then flaunt a single logo at a time. Mix-n-match it with other clothing to complete your look.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Show Deep Love for Your Sneakers</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Your sneakers should be exquisite! Streetwear styling is incomplete without the right pair of sneakers. Jordan, HUF, Nike, Balenciaga, Vetements and several more brands sell incredible pairs of streetwear sneakers. You don’t actually have to invest in an expensive brand just look for local contemporary artist who can paint for you, then just buy a pair of solid color sneakers, and have it custom-painted by them for an exceptional and rare look.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Balance the Proportions</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Although streetwear is all about wearing bigger-sized clothes, you don’t actually have to wear twice or thrice your size bigger clothes. Just wear loose clothing that is comfortable and not extremely oversized – it would be totally unforgiving! Dump figure-hugging pants and go for straight-leg-shaped ones to offer a relaxed yet stylish look. While oversized bomber jackets would look ravishing on the teens, a cropped jacket will help you fit in flawlessly with the streetwear style without making you look floppy.</p>
                
                <h4 className="article-subheading">Accesorize Right</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Sunglasses, hats or caps, scarves, bags, belts, or jewelry – use them in cool ways to define your special streetstyle look. For instance, a chunky necklace over a knit top would definitely be a statement look during an outing with friends. You can add a scarf to your clothing – there are so many colors and patterns to pick from. Hold clutches with dramatic additions to it, like a large colorful tassel or a furry embellishment. You can also wear cute socks in shades that match your dress.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">The Classic Due: Hoodies and Sweatshirts</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>They are an integral part of streetwear fashion and they give you an original street look. Sweatshirts will practically go with everything. Look for rare vintage prints and treasure them! Cult images, embroidered drawings and parody expressions look aesthetically original and superior on hoodies and sweatshirts. You will find both in different types of fabric to suit the climate type.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Graphic T-Shirts</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Graphic tees are the basics of streetwear fashion. Their prints are powerful and can be worn to represent your mood, style and the occasion. Remember to buy them in size bigger than yours and then select the pattern, colors and fonts that best compliment your signature street style fashion.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Cargo Pants</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Cargo pants are versatile and perfect for casual looks. Originally created in military colors, they have received upgrades from modern-day designers who have added their own style and design to them. They can now easily be worn by all ages without giving immature vibes.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Layer it Up</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Adding several layers of clothing is one of the basics of streetwear. However, the idea is to get it right. It may be tricky but once you learn a few tricks and tips, you will always get it right. Begin with thinner layers beneath and finish with bulkier ones. You must have a color scheme that complements each layer – to begin with, use various shades of the same color. Layering in streetwear is to allow every clothing to be seen. So, layer in a way that whatever you wear is visible – keep your jackets open or wear a longer t-shirt beneath.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>It takes some time to perfect your streetwear fashion, but once you get it right, you will look all there!</p>
