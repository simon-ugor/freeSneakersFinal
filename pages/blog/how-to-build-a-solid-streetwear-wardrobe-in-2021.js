                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Combinations - You are not bound to go by any dress code; in fact, you can make combinations of your own, and we are sure streetwear combinations turn out to be great.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Play with proportions - The rules of proportions specify which dress should be worn by whom?

Choose the clothes that might need a pocketful of money to make it to your streetwear collection, but in the longer run, you can use them for years.</p>
