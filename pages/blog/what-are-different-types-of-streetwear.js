                <h3 className="aboutus-heading">What are different types of streetwear?</h3>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear has gained so much popularity in recent years, transitioning from a more informal, everyday look to making appearances in high fashion. Today, one of the most popular styles is streetwear, yet the phrase itself might be perplexing. There are numerous forms of clothes that fit under streetwear and numerous subgenres of streetwear style.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear varies widely worldwide, with Tokyo's styles deviating significantly from those seen on London or New York streets. However, we've divided down the primary varieties of streetwear and their essential characteristics, pieces, and brands to make it easier. Let's look at the main types of streetwear in this article.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Types of Streetwear</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The broad term streetwear encompasses a wide range of clothing styles. These various streetwear styles also differ in different nations around the world. For example, streetwear in London may be quite different from streetwear in Tokyo. Here are a few examples of many forms of streetwear.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>1. Skate style</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>This streetwear fashion was adopted by skateboarders all across the world, as the name implies. The origins of this aesthetic can be traced back to California, where skater culture was born. Skateboarding began as a way for surfers to pass the time when there were no waves to ride. As a result, the skate style was influenced heavily by the American surfer style's casual, effortless looks, which featured graphic T-shirts, baseball hats, and shorts.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>While the style has developed since then, the essential concepts and informal atmosphere have stayed consistent. Summer skate style is the most authentic, with graphic tees, baseball hats, wide-leg shorts, and the traditional skate footwear, Vans, dominating the looks.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>In the winter, hoodies, loose cargo-style pants, flannels, and beanies are part of the casual aesthetic. The idea is to get a casual, personalized style that symbolizes the calm atmosphere of a Californian summer regardless of the weather.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>2. Techwear</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Techwear is an ultra-modern style that focuses on both style and usefulness that has gained popularity in recent years. Simply defined, it takes highly useful items like military vests and cargo pants and gives them a sleek modern spin by styling them with luxurious fabrics or a modern color palette like blacks and greys.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The utility of these pieces is inspired by sportswear and outdoor wear. As a result, tech wear includes various streetwear styles and materials, such as technical vests and GORE-TEX. Techwear, essential elements like a hard-shell jacket, is generally pricey due to its emphasis on high-quality materials, functionality, and sleek modern look. However, you can get a cheaper techwear style by sticking to a monochrome palette, adding sports- or outdoors-inspired embellishments (like reflecting accents), and shopping around.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>3. Hypebeast</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>This is the most popular and influential streetwear trend today, whether you want to call it high fashion, hypebeast, or hip-hop. Hip-hop artists like A$AP Rocky, Future, Kanye West, Migos, and others have embraced and promoted this style. Many even reference their favourite high-fashion streetwear brands and designers in their songs, such as Raf Simons and Rick Owens.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Designer logo wear is blended with streetwear staples like sweatpants, graphic tees, and shoes to create this look. With companies like Gucci, Prada, and Balenciaga embracing the streetwear movement and incorporating it into their catwalk designs, there's no shortage of runway inspiration for streetwear these days.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Other very significant Hypebeast labels include the cult-like Supreme, A Bathing Ape (also known as BAPE), famed for its signature shark hoodies, and newcomer Off-White, which has garnered the favour of a slew of celebrities since its launch. All you have to do is look at celebrities like the ones mentioned or popular blogs like HYPEBEAST, Complex, and others for high fashion or hypebeast style inspiration.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>4. Clout chasers</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>These people don't give a damn about culture and instead buy and wear the most expensive brands available. With streetwear fashion becoming more widespread and entering the world of high style, there will always be those that buy the newest, best, and most expensive items merely to prove to the world that they can.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>While it's difficult to say whether this is a style in and of itself, it's worth noting because a sizable number of people do precisely that: wear anything with a high price tag.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>5. Athleisure</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Athleisure refers to men's streetwear fashion to athletic clothes designed for leisure, such as sneakers, sweatshirts, and hoodies. This is one of the most popular and well-known types of streetwear all around the world. Many people who wear athleisure clothes do not consider streetwear, instead of categorizing it as just sportswear.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Differences between the East and West streetwear</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Because streetwear fashion is derived from each culture, there are minor variances between what is worn in the East and the West, regardless of current fashions and designs.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>Streetwear in the West</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>We all know that hip-hop culture began in the United States and that many of the world's most well-known companies originated there as well. As a result, there is no denying that many trends originate in the West. Distressed jeans, graphic tees, and looser-fit hoodies are streetwear in western culture that emphasizes lighter, softer tones. There is a propensity to simplify things, with people prioritizing comfort over all else. Hoodies, sweatshirts, and bomber jackets are staples in every Western wardrobe.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>Streetwear in East</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The streetwear styles of streetwear seen in the East differ slightly. There is less of a nod to hip-hop culture than the West, with most of the credit to the brilliant colors. Wild designs are more allowed, and there is a lot more mix-and-match between different sorts of apparel, thanks to k-significant pop's influence on Asia as a whole.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Furthermore, streetwear in the East tends to incorporate more workwear and a hint of prep into their fashion style, making it a little more form-fitting. Of course, each country in the East has its distinct look, and Japan may be the most distinctive of them all.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Final words</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Finally, any streetwear allows you to dress casually and comfortably while looking luxurious and traditional. It is undeniable that the entire world embraces streetwear fashion and style, and you should not be left behind. You can get any attire you require right on the street next to you.</p>
