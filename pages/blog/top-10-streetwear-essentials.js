                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>You may have linked the word Streetwear with different brands, mostly only a sticker of the brand attached on cheaper clothing items. But Streetwear is a lot more of the culture you exhibit rather than the product. But Streetwear is a genre of all contemporary outfits united in military looks and sportswear and speaks to different cultures and subcultures.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Many people make the argument that any item of clothing can be linked to that of Streetwear. Still, it has typically become linked with the young, laid back, athletic, and characteristically urban style profile despite its origin in the surf culture.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The aesthetic and feel with which we recognize Streetwear the likes of Shawn Stussy pioneered these days. Taking a t-shirt brand and then mimicking the limited feel of the high-end luxury brand. And those are the two main integral parts of what makes any brand a streetwear one.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Following are a few items you must have in your wardrobe if you wish to style in the form of Streetwear.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Graphic Tees</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Graphic tees are mostly what come flashing to the mind when someone thinks of streetwear staples, and indeed they have now become the only part of fashion genres in urban aesthetic. There isn't any need of limiting yourself to only popular brand names or those overpriced shirts having strategically placed holes.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Any graphic tee will have the same balance of effortless and cool. You can try out shirts from different local brands with logos and signs tributing to movies and seasons.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">A statement jacket</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>You can give off any look full of attitude using a statement jacket. Leather and denim are very important, plus points if yours is vintage, or you can jazz them up using cool patches. Try out bold colors for your jacket so that they can stand out and have all kinds of patterns made on the jacket, and explore the wildest options you can try.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Sneakers</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Considering Streetwear's connection with hip hop and sportswear, sneakers are a no-brainer in this field. When you pick some kicks for your OOTD, you either want to have a classic or a crazy option: some out-of-the-box, limited-edition sneakers or the reliable old trainers that go with almost everything.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Our no-fail pick is the pair of higher-cut converse shoes that will give you the right vintage and preppy touch. This is important, but you can try other colors too.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Combat boots</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Along with sneakers, having combat boots are also a perfect addition to the shoe rack for getting into that form of a streetwear-styled person. You can get those black combat boots as they are versatile enough to match them up with pants, shorts, and dresses.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>They will also give you that touch of 90s grunge, wearing some flannel if you are really into that punk vibe.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Good old pair of jeans</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>A reliable pair of denim jeans is the essential one and also a streetwear staple. However, rips are not needed but are more encouraged. Go for a simple but flattering silhouette that will show off your shape even when rocking the two sizes too big t-shirt.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Try on mid-waist jeans with a straight-cut cigarette silhouette and a mid-toned wash that will look good for many years. Plus, it will work on both tucked-in and untucked styles.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Track pants</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>If comfort is the main priority you seek while dressing up as a streetwear stylist, you should go for loose track pants. It will be perfect for you if you love athleisure. Though you can not seek comfort in the fashion world, track pants will both be stylish and comfortable; hence, you don't have to leave anything behind.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Go for a versatile pair of trousers whenever you want to look a bit more sporty. The contrasting white stripes will go down the side, frame up more shape, and give you a dimension.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">A hat</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Besides being a very cool addition to your outfit, a hat is also a handy accessory for keeping your face protected from the sun or hiding that messy hair. Sporty or statement caps are the right options for Streetwear, but those bucket hats are the right option too. You can have those beanies of bright colors like orange, red, or parrot green.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Funky socks</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Though it still thrives on the unnamed, capital C cool quality, there is still room for a bit of quirkiness in the streetwear style. You can also add some silliness and personality in your basic t-shirt jeans and white sneakers paired up with some cute pair of socks. Always fold up your pants to show off your socks.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Vintage sunnies</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear is mostly known as being too trendy, having new pieces favouring styles so unorthodox that they skip out of style so quickly that you buy them. But streetwear enthusiasts love bringing together modern with timeless, incorporating classic fashion staples to their OOTDs inspired apparel.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Shoulder bag</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear mostly carries the aura of effortlessness, so just set aside the bulky work bag and go for something more casual. A shoulder bag that we all love can be of bright colors like yellow or red. Fanny packs are also some cool options to go for as well.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>These were the most essential and top 10 Streetwear essentials that you must have in your wardrobe.
