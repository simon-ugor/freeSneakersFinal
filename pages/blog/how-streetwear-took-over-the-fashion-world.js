                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>When the word fashion was discussed a few years ago, the first thing that came to mind was high-end fashion labels' names. When we hear the words "fashion," we immediately think of Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Jimmy Choo. That, however, began to alter. Streetwear made its way into the fashion business and eventually took control.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Skaters and their surprise influence on pop culture helped to popularise streetwear in the early 2000s. Supreme and Stussy were at the height of their popularity, dominating the fashion scene in America and Europe soon after. Since then, streetwear has grown in popularity and expanded its reach.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>What was once the domain of skaters and adolescent males has evolved into a wardrobe staple. Everyone from models to performers can be spotted wearing casual Streetwear fashion. Despite its popularity has varied, it is still a feasible costume option for everyone - not only LA skaters.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>So, how did streetwear take over the fashion world? We look into the past, present, and growth of streetwear.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Where did streetwear start?</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The majority of today's popular streetwear businesses began in the 1980s; however, some have only recently acquired traction. Creating a fashion brand based on a specific persona/hobby was thought to be a clever approach to break into a completely new market.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>When it comes to men's urban clothes, California has long been a hotbed, with many of the largest names in the industry starting there. Some of the most well-known sports brands, including Nike, Adidas, and Puma, are now attempting to enter the streetwear industry.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Despite their expanding success, companies like Off-White, Bathing Ape, and Supreme have maintained their integrity. This has provided them an advantage over their competitors, as they are often regarded as the founders of streetwear fashion.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Celebrities' influence</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear is a fashion trend that celebrities have primarily adopted. The majority of these famous personalities will be dressed in streetwear. As a result, the demand for these streetwear garments has skyrocketed. Supreme, for example, has made a significant investment in streetwear apparel.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>These brands are promoting and influencing the streetwear style through social media. People's perceptions of fashion are greatly impacted by what they see on social media, and models and influencers are sometimes credited with setting the standard for what's in when it comes to what's on-trend. You know it's cool when models like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner wear premium streetwear.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>That is why many streetwear shops enjoy collaborating with other designers and celebrities to raise their visibility and promote their products to a wider audience.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">What makes streetwear fashion unique and popular?</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>1. A new perspective:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The streetwear Clothing style originated as a fringe movement that swiftly gained traction in the mainstream. This is because it provided the fashion world with something it didn't realize it was missing. It gave it a new perspective. Streetwear symbolized something new, something youthful, and something completely different from the norm.
                It quickly rose to prominence as a key effect on fashion's creativity, distribution, and marketing. As a result, when designers like Kanye West and Virgil Abloh created their streetwear collections, they immediately soared in popularity, attracting the attention of both luxury brands and fashion fans.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>2. The legitimacy:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The authenticity of streetwear is a fundamental element that keeps it together and propels it forward. The majority of streetwear buyers do not have hundreds or thousands of dollars to spend on high-end labels. Instead, they improvise with their originality and inventiveness, which keeps streetwear alive and well. 
                For example, we all know that tracksuits are comfy, but they become more than just that when decorated with appealing colors and patterns. It transforms into a sleek and attractive tracksuit. Genuine but fashionable is the essence of the Streetwear fashion world.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>3. The usefulness:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>One of the most appealing aspects of streetwear is that it is completely practical. Previously, practically everyone wanted to be fashionable and would wear whatever it took to acquire that position – no matter how uncomfortable it was. When street style became a practical and convenient fashion style, it was only a matter of time until consumers flocked to it and demanded it in large quantities.
                Streetwear is comfortable, snug, and cool all at once provide it a significant advantage over luxury goods.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>4. It's a cultural thing:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Community and a rejection of the current quo are at the root of streetwear codes. The distinction between streetwear and high fashion is not simply in the bags and purses but in the culture that surrounds each ensemble. It is a sign of a culture that includes art, music, and fashion. 
                It appeals to those not originating from the same culture because of the powerful spirit that underpins it. This is why luxury firms connect with CEOs who have never heard a rap song or even been to a Soho skate park but are open to incorporating streetwear into their brands. It's also why their diverse audiences are enthusiastic about it.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Growth of streetwear</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Though it appears that the fashion world is always evolving, with new trends and designs being introduced every season, it appears that designer streetwear isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The streetwear fashion craze isn't going away anytime soon, thanks to creative marketing and high-quality gear.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Brands are continuously partnering to create new, incredible collections, and every Supreme new release continues to generate excitement. It remains to be seen if streetwear has a fallback or if it will once again lose relevance. For the time being, it's at its height – and it's not going anywhere.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Final words</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Finally, streetwear allows you to dress casually and comfortably with your cool sneakers while yet looking luxurious and traditional. It is undeniable that the entire world embraces streetwear fashion and style, and you should not be left behind. You can get any clothing you require there on the street in front of you.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear evolved, made its way into luxury fashion, and took over with its freshness, authenticity, practicality, and profound culture. This is why streetwear clothing styles are becoming more popular by the day, and luxury companies such as Gucci, Balenciaga, and Saint Laurent are redefining luxury to include streetwear more generously.</p>
