                <h3 className="aboutus-heading">The ultimate guide for women's streetwear</h3>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Women's fashion in the streetwear line of accessories has grown into a special and highly desired part of the fashion industry. The trends, styles, and looks which come and are inspired by social changes may first be viewed in this label of fashion style. Many fashion critics have also classified streetwear as the pointer to what is coming next in fashion, as the trendsetter. Also, it seems that streetwear has a huge impact on the whole fashion industry.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>At present, women's streetwear styles are highly influenced by two big directives: the conscious lifestyle and conscious garments on one side and the politics, climate, and masculinity views on the other side. Here is what is most trending and fashionable in women's streetwear looks.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">What is streetwear?</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear is more of a casual fashion style that became highly popular in the 1990s. It infuses more comfortable yet trendy clothing such as hoodies, graphic tees, sweatpants, and more expensive sneakers. Streetwear takes inspiration from the hip hop culture and a skater style, with an element of intentional product scarcity. The followers of this latest trend in streetwear are known as hypebeasts ad most go to great lengths to get the limited edition designer hoodies, baseball caps, sneakers, and a lot more.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">A history of where streetwear came from?</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The very first streetwear brands rose up in Southern California in the 1980s. When surfers sold their screen-printed t-shirts to promote their hand-shaped surfboards, inspired by this street style of Los Angeles skateboarders and hip hop fashion, boutique skateboarding shops present in NY City started producing their very own designs in the 1990s.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>In the 2000s, sneaker culture centered around the expensive sneakers collection overlapped with and was also influenced by streetwear fashion. Hypebeasts paired those graphic tees with athletic sneakers, and then collaborations abounded.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>In the 2010s, luxury streetwear came into existence. As younger people and social influencers made this kind of dress-up an important part of pop culture, the whole fashion industry, from mainstream sportswear brands to high fashion brands, was played.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Adding colors and patterns to your looks will give you a straight entry into streetwear style. There are many ways you can layer up your clothes and make them look fashionable and above the higher end of styles. Mostly streetwear is a unisex form of dressup that anyone can carry and look cool and high in fashion.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">What are the 4 factors of streetwear style of clothing brands for women?</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>These four characteristics are the main elements of streetwear clothing:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>1. Comfort:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Streetwear clothing includes casual clothing and athleisure staples such as joggers and sweatshirts. If you cant skate in this outfit, it isn't probably streetwear.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>2. Scarcity:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Hypebeast culture is based on all limited edition items. It is a perceived scarcity that can make sought-after items a lot more fashionable. It is the same principle that underlies haute couture, but streetwear is a lot more accessible.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>3. Menswear style:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Although streetwear is very popular among people of all age groups and genders, it is closely tied to menswear and traditionally masculine items such as workwear and bomber jackets.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw", textDecoration: "underline"}}>4. Contemporary art:</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>Some highly successful graphic tees and streetwear logos buy or borrow from contemporary artists' work or poke fun at classic pieces. Sometimes these are sanctioned collaborations, and sometimes, they aren't.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Oversized garments:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The high trend of oversized garments has been very popular in the past few years, and its popularity is still getting bigger in 2021. With the higher accent and a focus on coziness and comfortability, the oversized trend is still going strong and dominant in the current year.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Striking bold sneakers:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>When it is the case of trends that are concerned with sneakers, the trend of having ugly sneakers was preset for a good long while. But now, the trends shift over to bold sneakers that come in many different colors and styles that perfectly match oversized styles.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Beiges overall:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>As defined by fashion minds, beige isn't a color, and it is a style. With this being said, beige is becoming more and more prevalent in women wearing streetwear outfits. The ideal way to wear this style is in more monochromatic looks that are beige head to toe.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Techwear:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>This is a very new and fresh entry into the women's streetwear style that comes in techwear. Its popularity is so big that it may become the most status showing style. The only thing you have to pay attention to when you are going with this style is not overdoing it by wearing some flashy head-to-toe techwear. It should be relaxed just having the street style in its core meaning.</p>

                <h4 className="article-subheading">Mixing casual and classic:</h4>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>One of the best ways to dress up as a streetwear enthusiast is to blend in the classic and the casual. This may be done by picking pieces that are different but go well together. Also, the layering of most different brands in look may add uniqueness to the whole attire.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{marginBottom: "2vh", paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The main art of wearing streetwear outfits for women is always to be yourself. If you can not show your true personality and your hidden beauty of aura through your clothing, that clothing won't ever be enjoyable for you. You must always wear dresses that look ideal on you and also speak to your soul. You can be a real fashionista if there is a sense in how to identify which dressing items are needed in your streetwear items.</p>

                <p className="article-text" style={{paddingLeft: "5vw", paddingRight: "5vw"}}>The tips mentioned above on styling up your clothing in mainstream streetwear will help you carry yourself the best way possible. You can start wearing a functional fashion that is loud, bold, and very symmetric. A flirty summer dress can be made streetwear by adding huge sneakers and logo tees by layering clothing.</p>
